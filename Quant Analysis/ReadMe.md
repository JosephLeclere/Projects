I've been following since its start the token $LYNK on Raydium.

In this project, I've extracted during 12 hours all the transactions that have been made on chain and used it to infer statistical properties of the token price dynamics.

We explored the asymmetry between buy and sell price impact due to the locked liquidity supply, and the formation of rough volatility on those short time frames.

We put out the data used for the analysis as well if one wishes to reproduce or explore other phenomenons in the data.
