There are two small projects I've realized recently on this repo:

• Did an interactive chess game app to support the $LYNK community with FOMO memes as chess pieces.
Threw in there a picture of the output of the game interface, people were quite happy. I need to work more on the interface to have the buttons fitting in a nicer way.

• Some statistical analysis on high-frequency transaction data on the memecoin pair $LYNK / SOL to discuss the volatility dynamics and market impact.
